    <p>Calmly, feel myself evolving
Appalling, so much I'm not divulging
Been stalling, I think I hear applauding, they're calling
      <span>Mixtapes aren't my thing, but it's been awfully exhausting</span>
Hanging onto songs this long is daunting (yeah)
Which caused me to have to make a call I thought was ballsy
Resulting in what you see today, proceed indulging
    As always, the one trick pony's here, so quit your sulking</p>
